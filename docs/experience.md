## Challenges
- Handling Decorators in langchain fuctions FAST API calls.
- Different work setup with auto-trained LLM model parameters resulting in different outputs
- Desirable outputs after more than 5 trials
- Implementing async calls for api and chat interactions with backend.

## Learnings
- Learnt how to use `langchain`, `plotly` libraries
- Gained more experience with FAST API and Streamlit.
- Efficient and machine understandable prompt engineering formats.
- Using `mkdocs-material` made documentation easier.
- Modularizing code helped with maintainability.

## Future Scope
- Using more functions and trying out nested functions
- Utilizing langgraphs to prevent more accurate result
